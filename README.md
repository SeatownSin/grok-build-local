# grok-build-local

A **local-first, privacy-focused fork** of **Grok Build** (`grok`) — xAI's
terminal-based AI coding agent — modified so it makes **no network calls to
xAI infrastructure by default** and runs entirely against **local or
third-party (BYOK) models**.

> **Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by xAI.** This is an
> independent modification of xAI's Apache-2.0-licensed source. See
> [Relationship to upstream](#relationship-to-upstream).

It runs as a full-screen TUI that understands your codebase, edits files,
executes shell commands, and manages long-running tasks — interactively,
headlessly for scripting/CI, or embedded in editors via the Agent Client
Protocol (ACP). The binary artifact is `xai-grok-pager` and installs as `grok`.

## What's different from upstream

This fork removes every path that sends data to, or pulls data from, xAI/Grok
servers, and adds first-class support for local models. The changes:

- **No xAI network egress — enforced at the network boundary.** A shared
  predicate refuses any request to `x.ai`/`grok.com` (and subdomains) at the
  point a socket would open: the inference client, OIDC login **and** token
  refresh, device-code login, the model-catalog and subagent-bundle fetches,
  managed-config, the sandbox/relay/workspace backends, memory embeddings,
  voice STT, and session-storage upload. No config, env var, or remote setting
  can re-enable it.
- **Telemetry and phone-home removed.** The Mixpanel crate is deleted; product
  analytics, OTLP trace export, Sentry, the feedback/session-signals API, the
  startup announcements/settings prefetch, the changelog CDN pull, billing/
  paywall checks, and automatic update polling are all gone or hard-disabled.
- **Local & BYOK models, no login.** Point a `[model.*]` entry at any
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Loopback servers (Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio,
  vLLM at `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`[::1]`) are auto-detected as no-auth: no API
  key, no browser login, and your session token is never sent to them.
  `context_window` is optional (defaults to 200k). See
  [Configuring a local model](#configuring-a-local-model).
- **Grok models hidden.** The xAI-hosted default models are hidden from the
  picker (they're unusable here); your local/BYOK models are all that show.
- **First-run setup wizard.** With no model configured, launch drops into a
  short wizard that scans `localhost` for a running model server and writes the
  config for you — replacing the (removed) login screen.
- **Windows build support.** The proto codegen no longer depends on
  `/dev/stdout`, so the workspace builds natively on Windows.
- **Updates from this repo.** `grok update` pulls GitHub Releases from
  `SeatownSin/grok-build-local`, not the x.ai CDN.

The inference request path itself is unchanged and provider-neutral (OpenAI
Chat Completions / Responses, or Anthropic Messages) — only *where* it is
allowed to connect changed.

> **The one xAI-origin path that remains** is the optional plugin marketplace:
> its official source is `github.com/xai-org/plugin-marketplace` (GitHub, not
> `x.ai`/`grok.com`). Auto-registration of that source is **off by default**
> (the remote-config path that could enable it is removed), so it is never
> fetched unless you explicitly opt in and run a plugin command. Point it at
> your own source, or don't use it, to stay fully clear of xAI-origin content.

## Building from source

Requirements:

- **Rust** — the toolchain is pinned by [`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml);
  `rustup` installs it automatically on first build.
- **protoc** — proto codegen needs Protocol Buffers.
  - *macOS / Linux:* [`bin/protoc`](bin/protoc) resolves via
    [DotSlash](https://dotslash-cli.com) (`cargo install dotslash`), or falls
    back to a `protoc` on `PATH`.
  - *Windows:* the `bin/protoc` DotSlash shim is Linux-only — install
    [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) and put it on
    `PATH` or set `PROTOC` to its full path.

```sh
cargo run -p xai-grok-pager-bin              # build + launch the TUI
cargo build -p xai-grok-pager-bin --release  # release binary: target/release/xai-grok-pager
cargo check -p xai-grok-pager-bin            # fast validation
```

**First launch.** With no model configured, the first run drops into a short
setup wizard: it scans `localhost` for a running model server (Ollama, LM
Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM), lets you pick a detected model or enter an endpoint
manually, writes it to `~/.grok/config.toml`, and starts straight into a
session. Quit the wizard and it exits cleanly. Prefer to set things up ahead of
time? Configure a model up front ([below](#configuring-a-local-model)) and
launch goes directly to a session — no wizard, no login. There is no browser
auth flow to xAI in this build.

## Configuring a local model

The first-run wizard writes this for you, but you can also add or edit models in
`~/.grok/config.toml` by hand. A loopback endpoint needs nothing else — no key,
no login:

```toml
[model.local]
model = "your-model-id"                 # slug your server expects
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"  # Ollama / llama.cpp / LM Studio / vLLM
name = "Local model"                    # shown in the picker
context_window = 8192                   # optional; defaults to 200000

[models]
default = "local"                       # make it the default for new sessions
```

For a non-loopback server that also needs no auth, set `no_auth = true`. For a
keyed provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, …), set `api_key`/`env_key` and `base_url` as
usual. Full details:
[`docs/user-guide/11-custom-models.md`](crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/docs/user-guide/11-custom-models.md).

## Updates

`grok update` checks **GitHub Releases** on this repo
(`SeatownSin/grok-build-local`) via the `gh` CLI. Publish releases with a
`v<version>` tag and assets named `grok-<version>-<os>-<arch>` (a `.exe` suffix
is also accepted on Windows). Automatic on-launch update checks are removed;
`grok update` is explicit only.

## Running the tests

Most of the test suite assumes a Unix layout (hard-coded `/tmp` paths in
helpers, advisory file locking), so **~600 tests fail on Windows-native for
harness reasons, not product bugs**. Run the suite under **WSL2 / Linux** for a
clean signal:

```sh
PROTOC=/path/to/protoc cargo test -p xai-grok-shell --lib
```

A `.gitattributes` pins LF line endings so a Windows checkout doesn't break the
pinned-copy template tests.

## Development

```sh
cargo check -p <crate>        # always target specific crates; full-workspace builds are slow
cargo test -p xai-grok-config # per-crate tests (see "Running the tests" re: WSL)
cargo clippy -p <crate>       # lint config: clippy.toml at the repo root
cargo fmt --all               # rustfmt.toml at the repo root
```
