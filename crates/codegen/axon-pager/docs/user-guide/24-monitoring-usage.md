# Monitoring Usage

**Axon does not phone home.** This fork removes the upstream telemetry and
analytics subsystem entirely: there is no product-analytics pipeline, no
session/trace upload, no Sentry, no feedback API, and no OpenTelemetry (OTLP)
export stream. There is nothing to opt out of, because nothing is sent.

- **No calls to xAI.** Axon makes no network requests to any xAI service, and
  those hosts are refused at the network boundary regardless of configuration.
- **No account, usage, or billing data.** Axon has no hosted account, so there
  is no remote usage dashboard, quota page, or billing surface to display.
- **No external telemetry sink.** The `AXON_TELEMETRY_*` and `AXON_EXTERNAL_OTEL`
  knobs from upstream are not wired to any exporter in this build; there is no
  `[telemetry]` config block that ships data anywhere.

## What you can still see locally

Usage information that Axon surfaces is computed and displayed **in-session
only** — it never leaves your machine:

- **Token counts and cost estimates** for the current session are shown in the
  TUI (cost figures are local estimates based on the model you configured, not
  billed amounts from any provider).
- **Session history** lives under `~/.axon/sessions/` and can be inspected with
  your own tools.

If you need fleet-wide observability, run everything through your own
OpenAI-compatible proxy (`AXON_CLI_CHAT_PROXY_BASE_URL`) and collect metrics at
that proxy — Axon itself emits no telemetry.
